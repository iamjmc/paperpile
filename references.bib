  abstract = "Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), an overall marker of
              neighborhood conditions, may determine residents' access to
              health care, independently of their own individual
              characteristics. It remains unclear, however, how the distinct
              settings where individuals seek care vary by neighborhood SES,
              particularly in US urban areas. With existing literature being
              relatively old, revealing how these associations might have
              changed in recent years is also timely in this US health care
              reform era. Using data on the Philadelphia region from 2002 to
              2012, we performed multilevel analysis to examine the
              associations of neighborhood SES (measured as census tract median
              household income) with access to usual sources of primary care
              (physician offices, community health centers, and hospital
              outpatient clinics). We found no evidence that residence in a
              low-income (versus high-income) neighborhood was associated with
              poorer overall access. However, low-income neighborhood residence
              was associated with less reliance on physician offices [-4.40
              percentage points; 95 \% confidence intervals (CI) -5.80, -3.00]
              and greater reliance on the safety net provided by health centers
              [2.08; 95 \% CI 1.42, 2.75] and outpatient clinics [1.61; 95 \%
              CI 0.97, 2.26]. These patterns largely persisted over the 10
              years investigated. These findings suggest that safety-net
              providers have continued to play an important role in ensuring
              access to primary care in urban, low-income communities, further
              underscoring the importance of supporting a strong safety net to
              ensure equitable access to care regardless of place of residence.",

  title    = "Prevalence of multiple chronic conditions in the United States'
              Medicare population",
  author   = "Schneider, Kathleen M and O'Donnell, Brian E and Dean, Debbie",
  abstract = "In 2006, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which
              administers the Medicare program in the United States, launched
              the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW). The CCW contains all
              Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) institutional and
              non-institutional claims, nursing home and home health assessment
              data, and enrollment/eligibility information from January 1, 1999
              forward for a random 5\% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (and
              100\% of the Medicare population from 2000 forward). Twenty-one
              predefined chronic condition indicator variables are coded within
              the CCW, to facilitate research on chronic conditions. The
              current article describes this new data source, and the authors
              demonstrate the utility of the CCW in describing the extent of
              chronic disease among Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare claims
              were analyzed to determine the prevalence, utilization, and
              Medicare program costs for some common and high cost chronic
              conditions in the Medicare FFS population in 2005. Chronic
              conditions explored include diabetes, chronic obstructive
              pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, cancer, chronic kidney
              disease (CKD), and depression. Fifty percent of Medicare FFS
              beneficiaries were receiving care for one or more of these
              chronic conditions. The highest prevalence is observed for
              diabetes, with nearly one-fourth of the Medicare FFS study cohort
              receiving treatment for this condition (24.3 percent). The annual
              number of inpatient days during 2005 is highest for CKD (9.51
              days) and COPD (8.18 days). As the number of chronic conditions
              increases, the average per beneficiary Medicare payment amount
              increases dramatically. The annual Medicare payment amounts for a
              beneficiary with only one of the chronic conditions is \$7,172.
              For those with two conditions, payment jumps to \$14,931, and for
              those with three or more conditions, the annual Medicare payments
              per beneficiary is \$32,498. The CCW data files have tremendous
              value for health services research. The longitudinal data and
              beneficiary linkage within the CCW are features of this data
              source which make it ideal for further studies regarding disease
              prevalence and progression over time. As additional years of
              administrative data are accumulated in the CCW, the expanded
              history of beneficiary services increases the value of this
              already rich data source.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To review methods of measuring racial/ethnic health
              care disparities. STUDY DESIGN: Identification and tracking of
              racial/ethnic disparities in health care will be advanced by
              application of a consistent definition and reliable empirical
              methods. We have proposed a definition of racial/ethnic health
              care disparities based in the Institute of Medicine's (IOM)
              Unequal Treatment report, which defines disparities as all
              differences except those due to clinical need and preferences.
              After briefly summarizing the strengths and critiques of this
              definition, we review methods that have been used to implement
              it. We discuss practical issues that arise during implementation
              and expand these methods to identify sources of disparities. We
              also situate the focus on methods to measure racial/ethnic health
              care disparities (an endeavor predominant in the United States)
              within a larger international literature in health outcomes and
              health care inequality. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: We compare
              different methods of implementing the IOM definition on
              measurement of disparities in any use of mental health care and
              mental health care expenditures using the 2004-2008 Medical
              Expenditure Panel Survey. CONCLUSION: Disparities analysts should
              be aware of multiple methods available to measure disparities and
              their differing assumptions. We prefer a method concordant with
              the IOM definition.",

  abstract = "Measuring and monitoring socioeconomic health inequalities are
              critical for understanding the impact of policy decisions.
              However, the measurement of health inequality is far from value
              neutral, and one can easily present the measure that best
              supports one's chosen conclusion or selectively exclude measures.
              Improving people's understanding of the often implicit value
              judgments is therefore important to reduce the risk that
              researchers mislead or policymakers are misled. While the choice
              between relative and absolute inequality is already value laden,
              further complexities arise when, as is often the case, health
              variables have both a lower and upper bound, and thus can be
              expressed in terms of either attainments or shortfalls, such as
              for mortality/survival.We bring together the recent parallel
              discussions from epidemiology and health economics regarding
              health inequality measurement and provide a deeper understanding
              of the different value judgments within absolute and relative
              measures expressed both in attainments and shortfalls, by
              graphically illustrating both hypothetical and real examples. We
              show that relative measures in terms of attainments and
              shortfalls have distinct value judgments, highlighting that for
              health variables with two bounds the choice is no longer only
              between an absolute and a relative measure but between an
              absolute, an attainment- relative and a shortfall-relative one.
              We illustrate how these three value judgments can be combined
              onto a single graph which shows the rankings according to all
              three measures, and illustrates how the three measures provide
              ethical benchmarks against which to judge the difference in
              inequality between populations.",

              cases within health care administrative databases for different
              research purposes, populations, and data sources. METHODS: We
              linked health care administrative databases from Ontario, Canada
              to a reference standard of primary care electronic medical
              records (EMRs). We then identified and calculated the performance

              using combinations of data sources and time windows. RESULTS: The
              best algorithm to identify diabetes cases was the presence at any
              time of one hospitalization or physician claim for diabetes AND
              either one prescription for an anti-diabetic medication or one

              three physician claims for diabetes within one year was highly
