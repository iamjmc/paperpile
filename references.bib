  abstract = "In 2006, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which
              administers the Medicare program in the United States, launched
              the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW). The CCW contains all
              Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) institutional and
              non-institutional claims, nursing home and home health assessment
              data, and enrollment/eligibility information from January 1, 1999
              forward for a random 5\% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (and
              100\% of the Medicare population from 2000 forward). Twenty-one
              predefined chronic condition indicator variables are coded within
              the CCW, to facilitate research on chronic conditions. The
              current article describes this new data source, and the authors
              demonstrate the utility of the CCW in describing the extent of
              chronic disease among Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare claims
              were analyzed to determine the prevalence, utilization, and
              Medicare program costs for some common and high cost chronic
              conditions in the Medicare FFS population in 2005. Chronic
              conditions explored include diabetes, chronic obstructive
              pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, cancer, chronic kidney
              disease (CKD), and depression. Fifty percent of Medicare FFS
              beneficiaries were receiving care for one or more of these
              chronic conditions. The highest prevalence is observed for
              diabetes, with nearly one-fourth of the Medicare FFS study cohort
              receiving treatment for this condition (24.3 percent). The annual
              number of inpatient days during 2005 is highest for CKD (9.51
              days) and COPD (8.18 days). As the number of chronic conditions
              increases, the average per beneficiary Medicare payment amount
              increases dramatically. The annual Medicare payment amounts for a
              beneficiary with only one of the chronic conditions is \$7,172.
              For those with two conditions, payment jumps to \$14,931, and for
              those with three or more conditions, the annual Medicare payments
              per beneficiary is \$32,498. The CCW data files have tremendous
              value for health services research. The longitudinal data and
              beneficiary linkage within the CCW are features of this data
              source which make it ideal for further studies regarding disease
              prevalence and progression over time. As additional years of
              administrative data are accumulated in the CCW, the expanded
              history of beneficiary services increases the value of this
              already rich data source.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Health care data allow for the study and surveillance
              of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The objective of this study
              was to identify and validate optimal algorithms for diabetes
              cases within health care administrative databases for different
              research purposes, populations, and data sources. METHODS: We
              linked health care administrative databases from Ontario, Canada
              to a reference standard of primary care electronic medical
              records (EMRs). We then identified and calculated the performance
              characteristics of multiple adult diabetes case definitions,
              using combinations of data sources and time windows. RESULTS: The
              best algorithm to identify diabetes cases was the presence at any
              time of one hospitalization or physician claim for diabetes AND
              either one prescription for an anti-diabetic medication or one
              physician claim with a diabetes-specific fee code [sensitivity
              84.2\%, specificity 99.2\%, positive predictive value (PPV)
              92.5\%]. Use of physician claims alone performed almost as well:
              three physician claims for diabetes within one year was highly
              specific (sensitivity 79.9\%, specificity 99.1\%, PPV 91.4\%) and
              one physician claim at any time was highly sensitive (sensitivity
              93.6\%, specificity 91.9\%, PPV 58.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study
              identifies validated algorithms to capture diabetes cases within
              health care administrative databases for a range of purposes,
              populations and data availability. These findings are useful to
              study trends and outcomes of diabetes using routinely-collected
              health care data.",
