              poorer overall access. However, low-income neighborhood residence
              was associated with less reliance on physician offices [-4.40

  abstract = "In 2006, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which
              administers the Medicare program in the United States, launched
              the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW). The CCW contains all
              Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) institutional and
              non-institutional claims, nursing home and home health assessment
              data, and enrollment/eligibility information from January 1, 1999
              forward for a random 5\% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (and
              100\% of the Medicare population from 2000 forward). Twenty-one
              predefined chronic condition indicator variables are coded within
              the CCW, to facilitate research on chronic conditions. The
              current article describes this new data source, and the authors
              demonstrate the utility of the CCW in describing the extent of
              chronic disease among Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare claims
              were analyzed to determine the prevalence, utilization, and
              Medicare program costs for some common and high cost chronic
              conditions in the Medicare FFS population in 2005. Chronic
              conditions explored include diabetes, chronic obstructive
              pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, cancer, chronic kidney
              disease (CKD), and depression. Fifty percent of Medicare FFS
              beneficiaries were receiving care for one or more of these
              chronic conditions. The highest prevalence is observed for
              diabetes, with nearly one-fourth of the Medicare FFS study cohort
              receiving treatment for this condition (24.3 percent). The annual
              number of inpatient days during 2005 is highest for CKD (9.51
              days) and COPD (8.18 days). As the number of chronic conditions
              increases, the average per beneficiary Medicare payment amount
              increases dramatically. The annual Medicare payment amounts for a
              beneficiary with only one of the chronic conditions is \$7,172.
              For those with two conditions, payment jumps to \$14,931, and for
              those with three or more conditions, the annual Medicare payments
              per beneficiary is \$32,498. The CCW data files have tremendous
              value for health services research. The longitudinal data and
              beneficiary linkage within the CCW are features of this data
              source which make it ideal for further studies regarding disease
              prevalence and progression over time. As additional years of
              administrative data are accumulated in the CCW, the expanded
              history of beneficiary services increases the value of this

              racial/ethnic disparities in health care will be advanced by
              application of a consistent definition and reliable empirical
              methods. We have proposed a definition of racial/ethnic health
              care disparities based in the Institute of Medicine's (IOM)
              Unequal Treatment report, which defines disparities as all
              differences except those due to clinical need and preferences.
              After briefly summarizing the strengths and critiques of this
              definition, we review methods that have been used to implement
              it. We discuss practical issues that arise during implementation

              also situate the focus on methods to measure racial/ethnic health
              care disparities (an endeavor predominant in the United States)
              within a larger international literature in health outcomes and
              health care inequality. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: We compare
              different methods of implementing the IOM definition on
              measurement of disparities in any use of mental health care and
              mental health care expenditures using the 2004-2008 Medical

              be aware of multiple methods available to measure disparities and

              critical for understanding the impact of policy decisions.
              However, the measurement of health inequality is far from value
              neutral, and one can easily present the measure that best
              supports one's chosen conclusion or selectively exclude measures.
              Improving people's understanding of the often implicit value
              judgments is therefore important to reduce the risk that
              researchers mislead or policymakers are misled. While the choice
              between relative and absolute inequality is already value laden,
              further complexities arise when, as is often the case, health
              variables have both a lower and upper bound, and thus can be
              expressed in terms of either attainments or shortfalls, such as
              for mortality/survival.We bring together the recent parallel
              discussions from epidemiology and health economics regarding
              health inequality measurement and provide a deeper understanding
              of the different value judgments within absolute and relative
              measures expressed both in attainments and shortfalls, by
              graphically illustrating both hypothetical and real examples. We
              show that relative measures in terms of attainments and
              shortfalls have distinct value judgments, highlighting that for
              health variables with two bounds the choice is no longer only
              between an absolute and a relative measure but between an
              absolute, an attainment- relative and a shortfall-relative one.
              We illustrate how these three value judgments can be combined
              onto a single graph which shows the rankings according to all
              three measures, and illustrates how the three measures provide
              ethical benchmarks against which to judge the difference in

              explain how multiple racialized systems dynamically shape health

              This framework accounts for the dynamics of time-varying

              ``race'' variable as part of a social process (racism) rather
              than a separable, individual characteristic. We decompose the
              observed disparity into three types of effects: a controlled
              direct effect (``unobserved racism''), proportions attributable
              to interaction (``racial discrimination''), and pure indirect

              models. STUDY DESIGN: We discuss the motivation for including
              interaction terms in multivariate analyses. We then explain how
              the straightforward interpretation of interaction terms in linear
              models changes in nonlinear models, using graphs and equations.
              We extend the basic results from logit and probit to
              difference-in-differences models, models with higher powers of
              explanatory variables, other nonlinear models (including log
              transformation and ordered models), and panel data models.
              EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: We show how to calculate and interpret
              interaction effects using a publicly available Stata data set
              with a binary outcome. Stata 11 has added several features which

              coefficients for race can be interpreted as corresponding to the

              socioeconomic distributions early in life across racial groups

  abstract = "A large number of epidemiologic studies have focused on
              racial/ethnic differences, particularly between blacks and
              whites. Because health endpoints and racial categorizations are
              associated with socioeconomic status, investigators generally
              adjust for socioeconomic indicators. The intention is usually to
              control for confounding, thereby making groups comparable and
              excluding socioeconomic status as an alternative explanation to
              hypotheses of innate physiologic differences. A threat to the
              validity of these analyses is therefore the presence of residual
              confounding. We identify four potential sources of residual
              confounding in this analytical design: categorization of
              socioeconomic status variables, measurement error in
              socioeconomic indicators, use of aggregated socioeconomic status
              measures, and incommensurate socioeconomic indicators. Using

              the effect of residual confounding is to bias interpretation of
              data toward the conclusion of independent racial/ethnic group
              effects. Investigators often refer to possible ``genetic''
              differences on the basis of models that control for socioeconomic
              status. We propose that such conclusions on the basis of this
              analytical strategy are generally unwarranted. Racial/ethnic
              differences in disease are a pressing public health concern, but
              the current approach does not often provide a basis for inference

              outcomes by changing behavior with respect for individual
              freedom. Although there are some areas in which there is a
              genuine tension between public health and autonomy-childhood
              vaccine mandates, for example-there are many more areas where not
              only is there no tension, but public health and autonomy come
              down to the same thing. These areas of overlap are often rendered
              invisible by a thin understanding of autonomy. Better integrating
              newer theoretical insights about autonomy into applied ethics can
              make discussions of public health ethics more rigorous, incisive,
              and effective. Even more importantly, bringing modern concepts of
              autonomy into public health ethics can showcase the many areas in
              which public health and autonomy have the same goals, face the
              same threats, and can be mutually advanced by the same kinds of
              solutions. This article provides a schema for relational autonomy
              in a public health context and gives concrete examples of how
              autonomy can be served through public-health interventions. It
              marshals insights from sociology, psychology, and philosophy to
              advance a theory of autonomy and coercion that recognizes three

              (MA) plans limit in-network care to a specific network of
              Medicare clinicians. MA plans thus play a role in sorting
              patients to a subset of clinicians. It is unknown whether the
              performance of physicians who treat MA and TM beneficiaries is
              different. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether avoidable hospital stay
              differences between MA and TM can be explained by the primary
              care clinicians who treat MA and TM beneficiaries. DESIGN,
              SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study of a
              nationally representative sample of MA and TM beneficiaries in
              2019 with any of 5 chronic ambulatory care-sensitive conditions
              (ACSCs). The relative risk (RR) of avoidable hospital stays in MA
              compared with TM was estimated with inverse probability of
              treatment-weighted Poisson regression, both without and with
              clinician fixed effects. The degree to which the estimated MA vs

              MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Whether a beneficiary had avoidable
              hospital stays in 2019 due to any of the ACSCs. Avoidable
              hospital stays included both hospitalizations and observation
              stays. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 1 323 481 MA
              beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 75.4 [7.0] years; 56.9\% women;
              69.3\% White) and 1 965 863 TM beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 75.9
              [7.4] years; 57.1\% women; 82.5\% White). When controlling for
              the primary care clinician, the RR of avoidable hospital stays in
              MA vs TM changed by 2.6 percentage points (95\% CI, 1.72-3.50; P
              < .001), suggesting that compared with TM beneficiaries, MA
              beneficiaries saw clinicians with lower rates of avoidable
              hospital stays. This effect size was statistically significant to
              explain the 2\% lower rate of avoidable hospital stays in MA than
              in TM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study
              of MA and TM beneficiaries, the lower rate of avoidable hospital
              stays among MA beneficiaries than TM beneficiaries was
              attributable to MA beneficiaries visiting clinicians with lower
              rates of avoidable hospital stays. The patient sorting that
              occurs in MA plays a critical role in the lower rates of
              avoidable hospital stays compared with TM.",

              disenfranchisement-a form of structural racism-is likely to
              undermine the health of Black people, yet empirical studies on
              the topic are scant. We used administrative data on
              disproportionate felony disenfranchisement of Black residents
              across US states, linked to geocoded individual-level health data
              from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study, to estimate

              middle-aged and older adults, adjusting for other individual- and
              state-level factors. Results show that living in states with
              higher levels of racialized disenfranchisement is associated with
              more depressive symptoms, more functional limitations, more
              difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living,

              cases within health care administrative databases for different
              research purposes, populations, and data sources. METHODS: We
              linked health care administrative databases from Ontario, Canada
              to a reference standard of primary care electronic medical
              records (EMRs). We then identified and calculated the performance
              characteristics of multiple adult diabetes case definitions,
              using combinations of data sources and time windows. RESULTS: The
              best algorithm to identify diabetes cases was the presence at any
              time of one hospitalization or physician claim for diabetes AND
              either one prescription for an anti-diabetic medication or one

              three physician claims for diabetes within one year was highly

              analyzed. METHODS: We used four race and ethnicity categories:
              non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic, and
              Asian/Pacific Islander/Alaskan Native/American Indian (API/AIAN),
              as well as a combined non-NHW category, from the 2010 (latest

              Beneficiary Summary public use file for 84 hospitals in the New
              York City region. We assessed the relative distribution of race
              and ethnicity across hospitals grouped at different geographic
              levels (region, county, hospital referral region [HRR], or
              hospital service areas [HSA]) using the dissimilarity index.
              Hospital characteristics included quality star ratings, essential
              professional services and diagnostic/treatment equipment, bed
              size, total expenses, and patients with dual Medicare and

              between hospital-based racial and ethnic composition and
              quality/structural measures. RESULTS: Dissimilarity Index
              decreases from region (range 30.3-40.1\%) to county (range
              13.7-23.5\%), HRR (range 10.5-27.5\%), and HSA (range
              12.0-16.9\%) levels. Hospitals with larger non-NHW patients

              considerable hospital-based racial and ethnic segregation of

              2007 100\% Medicare file to calculate 30- and 90-day mortality
              rates for white and black patients admitted for acute myocardial
              infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia.
              STUDY DESIGN: We ranked all hospitals in the country by their
              proportion of discharged black patients and identified the top 10
              percent of these hospitals as black serving. We examined
              race-specific adjusted mortality rates and adjusted for
              differences in hospital characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At
              30 days, black-serving hospitals had, compared with
              nonblack-serving hospitals, similar mortality for AMI, lower
              mortality for CHF, and higher mortality for pneumonia. At 90

              We performed an observational study using patient-level data for
              acute myocardial infarction (5 care measures), congestive heart
              failure (2 measures), community-acquired pneumonia (2 measures),
              and patient counseling (4 measures). Data were obtained from 123
              hospitals reporting to the University HealthSystem Consortium
              from the third quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2005. A
              total of 320,970 patients 18 years or older were eligible for at
              least 1 of the 13 measures. RESULTS: There were consistent
              unadjusted differences between minority and nonminority patients
              in the quality of care across 8 of 13 quality measures (from 4.63
              and 4.55 percentage points for angiotensin-converting enzyme
              inhibitors for acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart
              failure [P<.01] to 14.58 percentage points for smoking cessation
              counseling for pneumonia [P=.02]). Disparities were most
              pronounced for counseling measures. In multivariate models
              adjusted for individual patient characteristics and hospital
              effect, the magnitude of the disparities decreased substantially,
              yet remained significant for 3 of the 4 counseling measures;
              acute myocardial infarction (unadjusted, 9.00 [P<.001]; adjusted,
              3.82 [P<.01]), congestive heart failure (unadjusted, 8.45

              pneumonia (unadjusted, 14.58 [P=.02]; adjusted, 4.96 [P=.01]).
              CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in clinical process of care measures are
              largely the result of differences in where minority and
              nonminority patients seek care. However, disparities in services
              requiring counseling exist within hospitals after controlling for
