  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although racial and ethnic minorities
              disproportionately use some hospitals, hospital-based racial and
              ethnic composition relative to geographic region and its
              association with quality indicators has not been systematically
              analyzed. METHODS: We used four race and ethnicity categories:
              non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic, and
              Asian/Pacific Islander/Alaskan Native/American Indian (API/AIAN),
              as well as a combined non-NHW category, from the 2010 (latest
              year publicly available) Medicare Institutional Provider \&
              Beneficiary Summary public use file for 84 hospitals in the New
              York City region. We assessed the relative distribution of race
              and ethnicity across hospitals grouped at different geographic
              levels (region, county, hospital referral region [HRR], or
              hospital service areas [HSA]) using the dissimilarity index.
              Hospital characteristics included quality star ratings, essential
              professional services and diagnostic/treatment equipment, bed
              size, total expenses, and patients with dual Medicare and
              Medicaid enrollment. We assessed Spearman's rank correlation
              between hospital-based racial and ethnic composition and
              quality/structural measures. RESULTS: Dissimilarity Index
              decreases from region (range 30.3-40.1\%) to county (range
              13.7-23.5\%), HRR (range 10.5-27.5\%), and HSA (range
              12.0-16.9\%) levels. Hospitals with larger non-NHW patients
              tended to have lower hospital ratings and higher proportions of
              dually-enrolled patients. They were also more likely to be safety
              net hospitals and non-federal governmental hospitals.
              CONCLUSIONS: In the NYC metropolitan region, there is
              considerable hospital-based racial and ethnic segregation of
              Medicare patients among non-NHW populations, extending previous
              research limited to NHB. Availability of data on racial and
              ethnic composition of hospitals should be made publicly available

              government reforms in the 2000s, which allowed for-profit
              surgical centers to compete with existing public National Health
              Service (NHS) hospitals in England. For-profit providers offer
              significant benefits, notably shorter waiting times. We estimate
              the extent to which different types of patients benefit from the

              benefits. Our counterfactual simulations show that, in terms of
              the value of access, entry of for-profit providers benefitted the
              richest patients twice as much as the poorest, and white patients
              six times as much as ethnic minority patients. Half of these

              health, while primary care referral practice plays a lesser,

              public hospitals at a competitive disadvantage.",

              adequacy of the skills they give to their graduates. The
              application is based on data gathered by a telephone survey
              conducted, about two years after the degree, on the graduates of
              year 2000 of the University of Florence. A multilevel multinomial

              means of maximum likelihood with adaptive Gaussian quadrature. In

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous injection-related infections (CIRI), such
              as abscesses and cellulitis, are common and preventable among
              injection drug users (IDU). However, risk factors for CIRI have
              not been well described in the literature. We sought to
              characterize the risk factors for current CIRI among individuals
              who use North America's first supervised injection facility
              (SIF). METHODS: A longitudinal analysis of factors associated
              with developing a CIRI among participants enrolled in the
              Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting (SEOSI) cohort
              between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 was conducted using
              generalized linear mixed-effects modelling. RESULTS: In total,
              1065 participants were eligible for this study. The proportion of
              participants with a CIRI remained under 10\% during the study
              period. In a multivariate generalized linear mixed-effects model,
              female sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.68 [95\% Confidence
              Interval (CI): 1.16-2.43]), unstable housing (AOR = 1.49 [95\%
              CI: 1.10-2.03]), borrowing a used syringe (AOR = 1.60 [95\% CI:
              1.03-2.48]), requiring help injecting (AOR = 1.42 [95\% CI:
              1.03-1.94]), and injecting cocaine daily (AOR = 1.41 [95\% CI:
              1.02-1.95]) were associated with an increased risk of having a
              CIRI. CONCLUSION: CIRI were common among a subset of IDU in this
              study, including females, those injecting cocaine daily, living
              in unstable housing, requiring help injecting or borrowing
              syringes. In order to reduce the burden of morbidity associated
              with CIRI, targeted interventions that address a range of
              factors, including social and environmental conditions, are
              needed.",
