  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Adequate access to primary and dental care is
              essential for population health, and some state Medicaid programs
              have expanded insurance coverage for both. However, there are few
              data on new Medicaid enrollees' ability to access services. We
              examined the relationship between provider supply and enrollees'
              identification of usual sources of care. STUDY DESIGN: Between
              November 2015 and February 2016, we surveyed low-income adults
              newly insured through Medicaid in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to
              determine if they had a usual source of care. Additionally, we
              used geospatial methods to calculate adult population per
              provider ratios by Census tract for primary and dental care
              providers who accepted Medicaid patients, then identified
              low-supply clusters. METHODS: We used multivariable logistic
              regression models to describe the odds of identifying usual
              sources of care based on being in low- or high-supply clusters,
              adjusting for patient demographics. RESULTS: Of 1000 contacted
              individuals, 312 completed the survey. Among respondents, 168
              were previously uninsured and newly enrolled in Medicaid; 66.7\%
              of this group identified a usual primary care provider and 42.3\%
              identified a usual dental care provider. In adjusted analyses,
              individuals living in low- and high-supply areas had similar
              likelihoods of identifying a usual source of primary or dental
              care. CONCLUSIONS: Many new Medicaid enrollees did not have usual
              sources of primary or dental care, regardless of nearby provider
              supply. Efforts to understand what improves access or engagement
              in healthcare among Medicaid enrollees are critical after
              low-income adults gain insurance.",

              accounted for 1 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of the

              settings where individuals seek care vary by neighborhood SES,
              particularly in US urban areas. With existing literature being
              relatively old, revealing how these associations might have
              changed in recent years is also timely in this US health care
              reform era. Using data on the Philadelphia region from 2002 to
              2012, we performed multilevel analysis to examine the
              associations of neighborhood SES (measured as census tract median

              (physician offices, community health centers, and hospital

              low-income (versus high-income) neighborhood was associated with
              poorer overall access. However, low-income neighborhood residence
              was associated with less reliance on physician offices [-4.40
              percentage points; 95 \% confidence intervals (CI) -5.80, -3.00]

              years investigated. These findings suggest that safety-net

              access to primary care in urban, low-income communities, further
              underscoring the importance of supporting a strong safety net to

              segregation across hospitals, using a disease for which
              substantial disparities have been documented. DATA SOURCES: Black
              (n=32,289) and white (n=244,042) patients 67 years and older
              admitted for acute myocardial infarction during 2004-2005 in 105
              hospital markets were identified from Medicare data. Two measures
              of segregation were calculated: Dissimilarity (i.e., dissimilar
              distribution by race across hospitals), and Isolation (i.e.,
              racial isolation within hospitals). For each measure, markets
              were categorized as having low, medium, or high segregation.
              STUDY DESIGN: The relationship of hospital segregation to
              residential segregation and other market characteristics was
              evaluated. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
              evaluate disparities in the use of revascularization within 90
              days by segregation level. RESULTS: Agreement of segregation
              category based on Dissimilarity and Isolation was poor
              (kappa=0.12), and the relationship of disparities in
              revascularization to segregation differed by measure. The hazard
              of revascularization for black relative to white patients was
              lowest (i.e., greatest disparity) in markets with low
              Dissimilarity, but it was unrelated to Isolation. CONCLUSIONS:
              Significant racial segregation across hospitals exists in many
              U.S. markets, although the magnitude and relationship to
              disparities depends on definition. Dissimilar distribution of
              race across hospitals may reflect divergent cultural preferences,
              social norms, and patient assessments of provider cultural
              competence, which ultimately impact utilization.",

               specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity

  title    = "Logistic regression: a brief primer",
  author   = "Stoltzfus, Jill C",
  abstract = "Regression techniques are versatile in their application to
              medical research because they can measure associations, predict
              outcomes, and control for confounding variable effects. As one
              such technique, logistic regression is an efficient and powerful
              way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on
              a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable's
              unique contribution. Using components of linear regression
              reflected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively
              identifies the strongest linear combination of variables with the
              greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important
              considerations when conducting logistic regression include
              selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant
              assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building
              strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be
              guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical
              investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate
              statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential
              confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic
              assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include
              independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous
              variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly
              influential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate
              number of events per independent variable to avoid an overfit
              model, with commonly recommended minimum ``rules of thumb''
              ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model
              building strategies, the three general types are direct/standard,
              sequential/hierarchical, and stepwise/statistical, with each
              having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching
              definitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods,
              one should formally quantify the model's internal validity (i.e.,
              replicability within the same data set) and external validity
              (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting
              logistic regression model's overall fit to the sample data is
              assessed using various goodness-of-fit measures, with better fit
              characterized by a smaller difference between observed and
              model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also
              recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally,
              results for independent variables are typically reported as odds
              ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).",

              uncontrolled hypertension, but it is unknown whether health
              insurance or neighborhood-level social deprivation is associated
              with greater reductions in blood pressure over time. Methods We
              estimated the association of health insurance and social
              deprivation index on blood pressure reduction over time using
              electronic health record data from 2012 to 2017. We included
              patients aged 19--64 years with an initial systolic blood
              pressure $\geq$150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure $\geq$100
              mmHg and $\geq$1 additional visit from 93 community health
              centers in states that expanded Medicaid in 2014. Results We
              included 66,207 patients: 20.1\% uninsured, 64.8\% publicly
              insured, and 15.1\% privately insured. Adjusting for patient
              characteristics and baseline blood pressure, systolic blood
              pressure/diastolic blood pressure declined over the study period
              by 21.3/11.2 mmHg, 22.0/11.4 mmHg, and 21.1/10.7 mmHg among
              uninsured, publicly insured, and privately insured individuals,
              respectively. There were small but significantly greater
              reductions in systolic blood pressure among patients with public
              insurance than among those who were uninsured (difference= −1.3,
              95\% CI= −1.6, −1.0) but none associated with social deprivation
              index. There were no differences in diastolic blood pressure
              reductions over time by insurance status or social deprivation
              index. Blood pressure control (systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg
              and diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) was significantly greater
              among publicly or commercially insured individuals than among
              uninsured individuals (51.7\%, 51.5\%, 44.6\% respectively, both
              comparisons p<0.001), with no associations between blood pressure
              control and social deprivation index. Conclusions Reductions in
              blood pressure were large but mostly not associated with
              insurance type or social deprivation index. Additional research

              non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic, and
              Asian/Pacific Islander/Alaskan Native/American Indian (API/AIAN),
              as well as a combined non-NHW category, from the 2010 (latest

              Beneficiary Summary public use file for 84 hospitals in the New
              York City region. We assessed the relative distribution of race
              and ethnicity across hospitals grouped at different geographic
              levels (region, county, hospital referral region [HRR], or
              hospital service areas [HSA]) using the dissimilarity index.
              Hospital characteristics included quality star ratings, essential
              professional services and diagnostic/treatment equipment, bed
              size, total expenses, and patients with dual Medicare and
              Medicaid enrollment. We assessed Spearman's rank correlation
              between hospital-based racial and ethnic composition and
              quality/structural measures. RESULTS: Dissimilarity Index
              decreases from region (range 30.3-40.1\%) to county (range
              13.7-23.5\%), HRR (range 10.5-27.5\%), and HSA (range
              12.0-16.9\%) levels. Hospitals with larger non-NHW patients

              analyzed 230,258 adult participants of the 1999 to 2009 National
              Health Interview Survey. We evaluated the association between 5
              specific barriers to timely primary care (unable to get through
              on telephone, unable to obtain appointment soon enough, long wait
              in the physician's office, limited clinic hours, lack of
              transportation) and ED utilization ($\geq$1 ED visit during the
              past year) for Medicaid and private insurance beneficiaries.
              Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for
              demographics, socioeconomic status, health conditions, outpatient
              care utilization, and survey year. RESULTS: Overall, 16.3\% of
              Medicaid and 8.9\% of private insurance beneficiaries had greater
              than or equal to 1 barrier to timely primary care. Compared with
              individuals with private insurance, Medicaid beneficiaries had
              higher ED utilization overall (39.6\% versus 17.7\%),
              particularly among those with barriers (51.3\% versus 24.6\% for
              1 barrier and 61.2\% versus 28.9\% for $\geq$2 barriers). After
              adjusting for covariates, Medicaid beneficiaries were more likely
              to have barriers (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.41; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI] 1.30 to 1.52) and higher ED utilization (adjusted
              OR 1.48; 95\% CI 1.41 to 1.56). ED utilization was even higher
              among Medicaid beneficiaries with 1 barrier (adjusted OR 1.66;
              95\% CI 1.44 to 1.92) or greater than or equal to 2 barriers
              (adjusted OR 2.01; 95\% CI 1.72 to 2.35) compared with that for
              individuals with private insurance and barriers. CONCLUSION:

              2007 100\% Medicare file to calculate 30- and 90-day mortality
              rates for white and black patients admitted for acute myocardial

              STUDY DESIGN: We ranked all hospitals in the country by their
              proportion of discharged black patients and identified the top 10
              percent of these hospitals as black serving. We examined
              race-specific adjusted mortality rates and adjusted for

              mortality for CHF, and higher mortality for pneumonia. At 90

              Quality Alliance Inpatient Quality of Care Indicators. METHODS:
              We performed an observational study using patient-level data for
              acute myocardial infarction (5 care measures), congestive heart
              failure (2 measures), community-acquired pneumonia (2 measures),
              and patient counseling (4 measures). Data were obtained from 123
              hospitals reporting to the University HealthSystem Consortium
              from the third quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2005. A
              total of 320,970 patients 18 years or older were eligible for at
              least 1 of the 13 measures. RESULTS: There were consistent
              unadjusted differences between minority and nonminority patients
              in the quality of care across 8 of 13 quality measures (from 4.63
              and 4.55 percentage points for angiotensin-converting enzyme
              inhibitors for acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart
              failure [P<.01] to 14.58 percentage points for smoking cessation
              counseling for pneumonia [P=.02]). Disparities were most
              pronounced for counseling measures. In multivariate models
              adjusted for individual patient characteristics and hospital
              effect, the magnitude of the disparities decreased substantially,
              yet remained significant for 3 of the 4 counseling measures;
              acute myocardial infarction (unadjusted, 9.00 [P<.001]; adjusted,
              3.82 [P<.01]), congestive heart failure (unadjusted, 8.45

              pneumonia (unadjusted, 14.58 [P=.02]; adjusted, 4.96 [P=.01]).
              CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in clinical process of care measures are
              largely the result of differences in where minority and
              nonminority patients seek care. However, disparities in services
              requiring counseling exist within hospitals after controlling for

               dosages of beta blockers. Many clinical and epidemiological

               characteristic at a particular time, or indicating whether a
               response occurred within a defined period of observation. In
               addition to evaluating a predictor of primary interest, it is
               important to investigate the importance of additional variables

              predominantly Mexican American border community affected by the
              expansion of Arizona's Medicaid program in 2001 and multiple
              community-level programs and policies. METHODS: We used data from
              a probability sample of 1623 adult residents of Douglas, Arizona,
              who participated in cross-sectional health surveys in 1998 and
              2010. Response rates were 83\% and 86\%, respectively. RESULTS:
              In 2010, participants were more likely to have a usual source of
              care, to have visited a provider in the previous year, and to
              have been screened for diabetes and hypertension and less likely
              to have delayed needed care or to have seen a regular provider in
              Mexico (P < .001 for all outcomes). Improvements in access to and
              use of health care were most pronounced among residents with less

              whose status within medicine is the subject of on-going debate.
              Some medical professionals regard it as a contentious illness.
              Others report a lack of confidence with diagnosis and management
              of the condition. The genesis of this paper was a complaint, made
              by an ME patient, about their treatment by a general
              practitioner. In response to the complaint, Healthwatch Trafford
              ran a patient experience-gathering project. METHOD: Data was
              collected from 476 participants (411 women and 65 men), living
              with ME from across the UK. Multinomial logistic regression
              investigated the predictive utility of length of time with ME;
              geographic location (i.e. Manchester vs. rest of UK); trust in
              GP; whether the patient had received a formal diagnosis; time
              taken to diagnosis; and gender. The outcome variable was number

              of whether the patient had received a formal diagnosis, were

  abstract = "Researchers and clinicians are frequently interested in either:
              (1) assessing whether there is a relationship or association
              between 2 or more variables and quantifying this association; or
              (2) determining whether 1 or more variables can predict another
              variable. The strength of such an association is mainly described
              by the correlation. However, regression analysis and regression
              models can be used not only to identify whether there is a
              significant relationship or association between variables but
              also to generate estimations of such a predictive relationship
              between variables. This basic statistical tutorial discusses the
              fundamental concepts and techniques related to the most common
              types of regression analysis and modeling, including simple
              linear regression, multiple regression, logistic regression,
              ordinal regression, and Poisson regression, as well as the common
              yet often underrecognized phenomenon of regression toward the
              mean. The various types of regression analysis are powerful
              statistical techniques, which when appropriately applied, can
              allow for the valid interpretation of complex, multifactorial
              data. Regression analysis and models can assess whether there is
              a relationship or association between 2 or more observed
              variables and estimate the strength of this association, as well
              as determine whether 1 or more variables can predict another
              variable. Regression is thus being applied more commonly in
              anesthesia, perioperative, critical care, and pain research.
              However, it is crucial to note that regression can identify
              plausible risk factors; it does not prove causation (a definitive
              cause and effect relationship). The results of a regression
              analysis instead identify independent (predictor) variable(s)
              associated with the dependent (outcome) variable. As with other
              statistical methods, applying regression requires that certain
              assumptions be met, which can be tested with specific
              diagnostics.",

              regression is one method frequently used in family medicine
              research to classify, explain or predict the values of some
              characteristic, behaviour or outcome. The binary logistic
              regression model relies on assumptions including independent
              observations, no perfect multicollinearity and linearity. The
              model produces ORs, which suggest increased, decreased or no
              change in odds of being in one category of the outcome with an
              increase in the value of the predictor. Model significance
              quantifies whether the model is better than the baseline value
              (ie, the percentage of people with the outcome) at explaining or
              predicting whether the observed cases in the data set have the
              outcome. One model fit measure is the count- [Formula: see text],

              examine the role of Medicaid coverage on care patterns for those
              with available safety net care, we assessed differences in access

              data on adult respondents from the 2014 Health Center Patient
              Survey (N = 1720) with continuous Medicaid coverage vs. those
              with some period without insurance coverage in the last 12
              months. We examined reported need for any medical care, mental
              health care, prescription drugs, dental care, and referrals for
              care outside of the CHC in the last 12 months, and reports of
              being delayed or unable to get needed care by insurance status.
              We used logistic regression to assess the association between
              insurance status and care access, adjusting for patient
              characteristics. RESULTS: Patients with insurance gaps and
              continuous Medicaid coverage reported similar levels of need for
              most types of care in the last 12 months, but those with
              insurance gaps were significantly more likely to report having
              difficulty obtaining medical care, prescription drugs, dental
              care, and completing outside referrals. Of those with incomplete
              referrals for care outside of the CHC, patients with insurance

              to having intermittent or no insurance coverage over the last
              year. Policies that increase disruptions in Medicaid coverage

              in access to health care for middle-aged (31 to 64 years of age)
              and older (65+ years of age) adults with disabilities by race and
              ethnicity, education, and income (n=13,174). Using logistic
              regression, we examined three measures of potential (e.g., usual
              source of care), and three measures of realized (e.g., counseling
              related to smoking) access. Middle-aged and older minority
              individuals with disabilities had lower relative risks of having
              usual sources of care and higher relative risks of having
              suboptimal usual sources of care (e.g., a place rather than a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The UK government is pursuing policies to improve
              primary care access, as many patients visit accident and
              emergency (A and E) departments after being unable to get
              suitable general practice appointments. Direct admission to
              hospital via a general practitioner (GP) averts A and E use, and
              may reduce total hospital costs. It could also enhance the
              continuity of information between GPs and hospital doctors,
              possibly improving healthcare outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine
              whether primary care access is associated with the route of
              emergency admission-via a GP versus via an A and E department.
              METHODS: Retrospective analysis of national administrative data
              from English hospitals for 2011-2012. Adults admitted in an
              emergency (unscheduled) for $\geq$1 night via a GP or an A and E
              department formed the study population. The measure of primary
              care access-the percentage of patients able to get a general
              practice appointment on their last attempt-was derived from a
              large, nationally representative patient survey. Multilevel
              logistic regression was used to estimate associations, adjusting
              for patient and admission characteristics. RESULTS: The analysis
              included 2 322 112 emergency admissions (81.9\% via an A and E
              department). With a 5 unit increase in the percentage of patients
              able to get a general practice appointment on their last attempt,
              the adjusted odds of GP admission (vs A and E admission) was
              estimated to increase by 15\% (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.17).
              The probability of GP admission if $\geq$95\% of appointment
              attempts were successful in each general practice was estimated
              to be 19.6\%. This probability reduced to 13.6\% when <80\% of
              appointment attempts were successful. This equates to 139 673
              fewer GP admissions (456 232 vs 316 559) assuming no change in
              the total number of admissions. Associations were consistent in
              direction across geographical regions of England. CONCLUSIONS:
              Among hospital inpatients admitted as an emergency, patients
              registered to more accessible general practices were more likely
              to have been admitted via a GP (vs an A and E department). This
              furthers evidence suggesting that access to general practice is
              related to use of emergency hospital services in England. The
              relative merits of the two admission routes remain unclear.",

              Utilizing a systematic review of the health and social science

              association through the lens of 4 questions of interest to
              epidemiologists: How is segregation best measured? Is the
              segregation-health association socially or biologically
              plausible? What evidence is there of segregation-health
              associations? Is segregation a modifiable risk factor?
              Thirty-nine identified studies test an association between
              segregation and health outcomes. The health effects of
              segregation are relatively consistent, but complex. Isolation
              segregation is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and
              increased mortality for blacks, but several studies report
              health-protective effects of living in clustered black
              neighborhoods net of social and economic isolation. The majority

              either poverty or race/ethnicity rather than a synergy of these
              factors. A novel version of the Index of Concentration at the
              Extremes (ICERace-Income) specifically assesses racialized
              economic segregation in terms of spatial concentrations of racial
              and economic privilege (e.g., wealthy white people) versus
              disadvantage (e.g., poor Black people) within a given area. This
              multidimensional measure advances a more comprehensive
              understanding of residential segregation and its consequences for
              racial and ethnic minorities. The aim of this paper is to
              critically review the evidence on the association between
              ICERace-Income and health outcomes. We implemented the Preferred

              ICERace-Income with adverse birth outcomes, cancer, premature and
              all-cause mortality, and communicable diseases. Most of the

              Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting (SEOSI) cohort
              between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 was conducted using
